# QR Backup

A completely client-side QR backup tool.  Scan the "export" code from your
authenticator app, then print a hard copy you can keep in a safe.  Then when
you die, your executor has a way to get into your accounts.

There is no server, and no data is sent anywhere, so your backups are safe.
You can run a copy of this offline if you wish.
